### Arranging for The Fresh Rhythm


*_Hello friends!_*

I've been arranging and transcribing for my band ['The Fresh Rhythm Big
Band'](https://www.facebook.com/TheFreshRhythm/) for about a year now, and I've
gotten numerous requests for a arranging guide of sorts for our ensemble. If
haven't heard us, check us out below.

Live at Disneyland in 2018

*While I am by no means an authority on arranging big band music*, I do have a
couple of tricks worked out for our particular ensemble. In this post, I will be
talking about a few points in particular that I notice people ask about
frequently and some that I find are sometimes a little bit tricky to work out.

* Full band tutti (shout sections)
* Rhythm section notation
* General arrangement considerations

Accompanying scores below will from Nestico's _The Complete Arranger_ as well
as some scores from the Fresh Rhythm's library. I expect that readers of this
mini-guide already have a *strong* understanding of:

* Early jazz harmony (1920s - 1940s ish)
* Basic orchestration
* Ensemble playing

## Basic Info

Our jazz orchestra consists of 12 musicians. We have 4 woodwinds, 4 brass, 3
rhythm section players, and one vocalist, Luke. I will list our players (at the
time of writing, November 2018) and their self-reported ranges below, *However*,
please do keep in mind that writing solely based of off these ranges (without
taking into account timbral and volume considerations) is a _significant_
oversimplification of the process.

All pitches denote a 'comfortable range' and are at *sounding* pitch.

* Baritone Voice - Luke Carlsen - A2 to G4
    * Best projection from C4 to F4
* Alto Sax 1 - Matt Cole - Db3 to G5
* Alto Sax 2 (Soprano Double) - Steven Ragsdale - Db3 to C6
* Tenor Sax (Flute, Picc., Clar. double) - Myles Davis - Ab2 to ∞(?)
* Bari. Sax (Bass Clarinet Double) - Martin Caestecker - C2 to G4
* Tpt. 1 - Tim Mathesin - E3 to Eb6
* Tpt. 2 - Chris Traynor - E3 to C6
* Bone 1 - Ramsey Hampton - E2 to Eb6
* Bone 2 - David Ferneau - E2 to D6
* Piano - Michael Seaman (your author) - A0 to C8
* Bass - Fizzo - E1 to D4
* Drums - Jessica Ragsdale - Bass to Crash

Keep in mind that the order above denotes the *prefered score order* from top to
bottom.

Now then, a possible next thought. _"8 Horns? How am I supossed to get a
convincing big band shout from *that*?!"_ Read on, my dear pupil...

## Full Band Tutti
#### Or, more specifically, "Doubled section block voicing".
___

Plenty of different textures can create satisfying "climaxes" for charts. I
have utilized all of the following

* Saxes unison, brass in 3 parts on counter-melody or rhythmic punches ([It
  don't mean a thing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cDgmiaKhPBrKzD91372GDIPyvleVHpZ-)
* Brass unison, saxes in 4 parts on counter-melody or rhythmic punches ([Can't
take my eyes off You, letter F](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nd-T-MFYBYZh31hk9hmRc_jeaER6IIEv))
* etc.
* Full band unison (Jump Jive an' Wail)

and found them *ALL* very effective. However, if you are looking to imitate the
texture of a "classic big band sound" (think Neil Hefti's
[Splanky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBTSoLzZ3-U&t=105)), I'd like to share
my 'secret sauce', as to how I accomplish this texture with our ensemble.

#### Doubled Section Block Voicing - For full big band

First, let's briefly dive into how one of the 'Golden Age Arrangers' may have
accomplished this sound with a full jazz orchestra (5 Saxes, 4 Tpts, 4 Bones).
While many approaches can achieve the texture, by far one of the most simple is
pictured below. This example is from Sammy Nestico's [88 Basie
Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OGuKLAvbt8&t=255), with the score
below provided from Sammy Nestico's _The Complete Arranger_. We're interested in
the first 2 bars.

![88 Basie Street]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_basie_street.png)

As evident from the score above, the melody is presented in the lead trumpet,
and 3 other lines (harmonizing the main melody from below) are presented in
trumpets 2 through 4. This 4 part voicing is then doubled down an octave in
the trombone section, and is also doubled in the woodwind section, also an
octave down. The bari. sax is the only instrument with the '5th voice', doubling
the bass line in the rhythm of the melody.

Of note in this example:

* While this excerpt is very easy to read and illustrates the point nicely, I
technically wouldn't call it a 'shout'. However,the concept is the same.
* In a true 'shout', I would expect the melody to sit a little bit higher, as
well as seeing support from the piano
* Still, you can see that the hits are supported in the rhythm section

#### The Lean Shout™

Trying to accomplish this texture with our instrumentation means that
(obviously) some doublings have to be cut. Let's try and create a shout for Ray
Noble's Cherokee. We're going to put it into Bb, feel it as a slow swing, and
utilize this lean doubling texture for the last 3 bars. Here is a lead sheet to
guide us in our process of writing harmonies and counter melodies.

![Cherokee Lead Sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_cherokee_lead.png)

Let's start off by writing a simple 4-part block-chord harmonization for the
given lead sheet. We may not end up using all voices at all times, and will
probably change it as needed, but looking at all four voices may prove very
helpful at keeping our texture simple further down the road.

I have written a simple 4 part harmonization for the melody and chords written
above. Nothing hip here folks!

![Cherokee 4-part block]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_cherokee_block.png)

And the same harmonization, split up.

![Cherokee 4-part]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_cherokee_4_part.png)

Some things to note here:

* The jump in the first 2 bars, 2nd and 4th voices proves to be a little bit
awkward sounding. We can remedy this later by adjusting the spacing (and thus,
which voice each instrument will cover) or possibly re-writing the line when
needed.
* This melody spans quite a large range between it's lowest and highest point.
Ignoring this may cause some unintended effects on volume and blend.

Now that we have our four voices already written, we can begin thinking about
which instrument is going to cover which voice. *The Lean Shout™ approach is as
follows:*

* Trumpets cover voice 1 and voice 3 (respectively)
* Bones cover voice 1 and voice 2 8vb
* Altos and Tenor Sax cover any combination either following group of voices:
(1,2,4) or (1,3,4)
    * Octave displacement may be necessary depending on the range of the lead
    melody
* Bari covers it's own 5th voice inspired by the bass line OR covers an existing
voice
* Piano has chord slashes and has the melody written as a cue
* Bass has chord slashes OR a written out part when necessary
* Drums have slashes and rhythmic cues for the lead line

This approach was designed entirely with our ensemble in mind and more or less
forms to the contours of our players' strengths and weaknesses. It should go
without saying, but this harmonization is *_only a base line_* to get started.
Rules like these were _meant_ to be broken.

Now, in the interest of time, we're going to skip ahead to a possible final
treatment of this short, 8-bar shout excerpt. Below is a completed Cherokee
shout section, complete with:

* Some variety to the texture: Bar 1 and bars 6-8 use The Lean Shout™ but bars
2-5 show saxes on their own unison counter-melody
* Adjusted spacing for the melodic leap in the first 2 bars
* A special 5th voice written for the bari. Notice how the instrument is often
placed in it's lower register for loud sections (as opposed to all other
  voices).
* Rhythm Section parts. Note how the rhythm parts support the climax at bar 6.

## Rhythm Section Notation

Rhythm section parts can be deceptively different from the parts of the wind
ensemble, as they are often times almost entirely improvised. Get used to this
slash notation!

![Rhythm Slash]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_rhythm_slash.png)

This can pose a problem to arrangers that are unfamiliar with the particular
style of writing. Luckily, learning to write easy-to-read rhythm section parts
(AKA good rhythm section parts) is a lot like riding a bike. Strange at first,
but difficult to screw up once mastered!

_A good rhythm section part, like any part, accurately displays the musical
intent of the passage whilst requiring *as little mental effort as possible from
the performer*._ In otherwords, K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple Stupid.

#### Drum Notation

For drum parts, there already exists a _fantastic_ guide written by the very
accomplished Tim Davies on his blog
(here)[http://www.timusic.net/debreved/jazz-notation-chords-drums/]. While the
guide is somewhat long, it will give you everything you need to know to write
a fantastic drum part that _anyone_ can read.

Some points I want to emphasize and add:

* Cue the ensemble parts often. Don't leave Jessica in 'slash hell' where it is
extremely easy to become lost. Example (from Tim Davies):

![Drum Cues]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_drum_cueing.png)

* If your part is outside of a normal beat, just write it out for a couple of
bars, then switch to slashes. I find that this is generally less confusing than
reading a strange style like 'Half-time euro Disco' and having to guess what
pattern that refers to. Example from letter *A* of the Mario Medley.

[Drum Cues]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh_arranging_1_mario_drums.png)

* Line up your systems with musical phrases. If your chart has 8 bar phrases,
have 8 bars to the system. This is also pictured above in the Mario Medley.


#### Bass Notation
