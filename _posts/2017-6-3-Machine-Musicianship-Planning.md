title: Machine Musicianship - Planning
---

What if I blogged that every piece of music ever created was just a particular series of patterns of sounds arranged in time? Well... That sounds very general and conservative. Wait, that's not how this hook is supposed to work.
Listen. I think computers can write music (or artwork, in general), and I'm going to spend my summer trying to teach one how to.

#### So let's take a step back. Why would I or anyone want to do this?
* It's cool. It'll be a lot of fun, and without a doubt, quite a big challenge.
* I'm a complete novice when it comes to deep learning and have only really been programming for 3 years. I know that I'm going to learn a lot.
* Weird music will be made
* Best case: **We can all learn something new about the nature of music and artwork**

#### Alright, let's take another step back. What even is music? What is artwork?
...On second thought. Let's not take that second step back.

#### OK! One last thing to consider.
As it turns out, the 'field' of computer composition isn't nearly as young as you might think. The practice dates back to about 1970 with composer Gottfried Michael Koening - but was actually described by Ada Lovelace (The world's first computer programmer) in the 1800's.
> The Analytical Engine might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engineâ€¦ Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.

Today, this work has become much more common: With such fast computers and such general learning algorithms, even non-experts can leverage existing algorithms to compose new, original music.

### The near future:
Over the next 2 weeks or so, most of my time is going to be spent reviewing papers, tutorials, and blogs to replicate findings and better understand the field. In particular, Andrej Karpathy's [LSTM blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), Lars Eidnes'  [Auto-Generating Clickbait With Recurrent Neural Networks ](https://larseidnes.com/2015/10/13/auto-generating-clickbait-with-recurrent-neural-networks/), and Hexahedra's [Polyphonic RNN's](http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/) are probably the most exciting.
Following that, I will be creating new models based on what seems effective from my findings. Stay tuned!
