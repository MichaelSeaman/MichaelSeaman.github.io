# Michael Seaman's Development Blog

Welcome to the github repo for [my website's development blog](http://blog.michael-seaman.com/).
The blog is hosted with Github pages and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to
generate pages. This blog uses [@jasonlong](https://github.com/jasonlong)'s [Cayman theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) on Github Pages.

The blog is currently the place for updates on all of my personal projects,
including the more recent:

* MIDI Laser Harp Development
* Machine Musicianship: Composition through Deep Learning
